# Purpose

This is a proof of concept interface that accesses the user's location data if allowed, and otherwise prompts them for their city/state and stores their response.

If they allow access, it also finds the nearest city using the OpenCage API.

If you want to use this interface, obtain an API Key from https://opencagedata.com/api#quickstart
